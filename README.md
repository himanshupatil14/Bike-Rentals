#  Bike Rental System in Java
A simple console-based Bike Rental System written in Java to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Composition**, and **List-based data management** using ArrayList.

This project allows users to rent and return bikes, manage customer details, and calculate rental costs through an interactive menu.
##  OOP Concepts Used
-  **Encapsulation**: All class fields are private and accessed via getter/setter methods.
-  **Abstraction**: The system hides internal logic from the user and provides a menu-driven interface.
-  **Composition**: The Rental class is composed of Bike and Customer objects.
-  **Modular Design**: Code is divided into logical classes (Bike, Customer, Rental, System, Main).

##  Features

- Add multiple bikes to the system
- Rent a bike by entering customer details
- Show only available bikes for rent
- Calculate total rental price based on per-day rate
- Return a bike and remove it from active rentals
- Input validation and status messages for user guidance
